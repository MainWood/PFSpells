# PFSpells
A windows forms app to make GMing slightly easier!

## What it does
This app takes a character name (this name becomes the name of the file - call it what you like) and a list of spell names. It queries d20pfsrd for these spell names and returns the spell details to an HTML file in a list.

Think of every time you've come across a wizard NPC who has 30 spells, some of which you barely know. Now you can generate her entire spellbook for future reference!

## How to run
1. Go to releases (https://github.com/bogga/PFSpells/releases)
2. Find the latest build
3. Download the source code (called PFSpells.zip)
4. Extract and run PFSpells.exe!
